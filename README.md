# ico_smartcontract
Smart Contract for ICO fundraising

This contract is just a test contract using the TPRV ticker on the Ethereum test network (Ropsten).

The contract is already deployed and can be tested by sending ETH to the following contract address:

Contract address: 0x3de07F39c1f0299CE1dc3d82E7C8B667e0dA8288

Please remember that this contract is only for the Ropsten (test) network. Please don't try to send any real ETH to this contract address.

Once we have finished the smart contract for the TGE funding we will post it here on Github so everyone can review it.
